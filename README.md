#HTSOHM-dev

Master Branch Status: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/WilmerLab/HTSOHM-dev.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/WilmerLab/HTSOHM-dev)

This is a package which can be used to map the structure-property space   
spanned by hypothetical, porous <i>pseudo materials</i>. This package contains   
modules that manage randomly-generating libraries of pseudo-materials,   
distributing many simulations across a computing cluster, and selectively   
mutating rare materials--in an iterative process.

## Getting started

The HSTOHM-dev libraries were written predominantly in Python3 and Bash. It   
also requires `RASPA-2.0`, available :   

https://github.com/WilmerLAb/RASPA2

To configure HTSOHM, you may run `configure.sh`, which modifies your .bashrc
file to add some necessary environment variables. PLEASE REVIEW the configure.sh
script before running it to make sure it applies to your platform and
environment.

You will need a database.yaml file for HTSOHM to use to store results in. You
can use the database.sample.yaml file (just copy it to database.yaml) if you
just want to use a local SQLite database. Otherwise, enter in your
connection_string into the database.yaml file per the format of the example
file.

To run the program, execute:    
  `python $HTSOHM_DIR/bin/HTSOHM.py <MpG> <NoA> <S0> <NoB>`    
`<MpG>` : number of materials per generation.   
`<NoA>` : number of atom-types.   
`<S0>`  : initial strength-parameter.
`<NoB>` : number of bins.

By default the program will terminate after 20 generations.
